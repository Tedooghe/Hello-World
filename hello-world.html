<p>I have done a version of 'hello-world' excersize in Flatiron </p>

<p>When I  committed the second time, the VSC screen did not show the heading in the first commit. I found that I deleated it by making that second commit. How do I see the first commit? do I merge them? </p>

<p>Funny, but I have forgotten how to 'src'a file from the web, but I know how to find and use that info</p>
